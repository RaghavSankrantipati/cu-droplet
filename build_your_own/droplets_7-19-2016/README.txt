This version of the Droplet's electronics includes fixes to minor problems with the first batch of Audio Droplets, ordered in March 2015.

Those fixes mean that this board is changed slightly, and it's always possible that those changes introduced new bugs in turn.

Thus, we can't guarantee that the board, built as presented in this files, will work perfectly. But it's the best/closest-to-working-perfectly that we have.

Note also that this BoM was when we were intending to replace motor 0 with a speaker (using the motor driver as a kludgy audio driver). 

If you want Droplets with three motors instead of a speaker, order one more motor per board. 
You'll also want to make a few simple changes to the code if you go this route. 
Please contact me for assistance once you've gotten this far. (john.klingner@colorado.edu)

Good luck!
