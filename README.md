Droplets: The Correll Lab Swarm Robotics Platform
==========

The platform is envisioned to be a scalable robotics experimentation environment.

TODO: Add Pictures once shells are finalized.

The hardware component comprises of the actual robot and the test bed/floor that experiments are run on. The robots are Ping-Pong ball sized devices capable of sensing (RGB color and IR sensing), actuation using vibration motors and communication, using analog/digital IR sensors. The embedded software layer is what we use to write and compile on-board code for the droplets. Each robot is equipped with an Atmel xmega-128a3u microprocessor capable of running embedded C-code. For more information on the hardware and low-level software API I would recommend reading complete write-up.
